      <description>T O P S T I C K     This is a game where you try to find the top stick among a bunch of other sticks. Once you have removed the top one, go the next one and the next one and then the next one and later the next next one and then&amp;hellip; . Ahem, anyways, you got the idea.
You have achievements to complete and you can compete against other players by signing in to Play Games app by Google.</description>
